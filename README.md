## About this project
For a coding challenge I created a simple website with the main task to manage posts.

**Features**:

- Search posts
- Delete posts
- Add posts

## Technical choices

Becuase it's simplicity and low amount of components, I decided to handle data with props downwards and also passing data upwards in some cases where I wanted to seperate logic to it's respective component.

## What was left out or what could be done differently?
